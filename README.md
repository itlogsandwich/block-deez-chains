# Blockchain Sandbox in Rust
### Just exploring and studying how blockchain works in rust.

## About
A simple rust sandbox using tokio and libp2p. I was curious about how blockchains work and the way they function as whole. <br>

The way peers can connect and mine alongside other peers was something I really wanted to figure out and also the way blockchains adjust during race conditions. <br>

The persistency is simple and written in json format. <br>

Depending on how bored I am, I might try and scaling this further to really understand more about blockchains and concurrency. For now, this will be it, but I am enjoying p2p networking. 

I will try to finish <a href = "https://github.com/itlogsandwich/focalpoint"> focalpoint /a> before scaling this further.
